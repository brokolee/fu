/* If that's not the problem, then maybe you have the two Java files in different
 *  Netbeans projects.  "Projects" are an IDE construct; they don't have anything 
 *  to do with the Java language.  A "package" is part of the Java language.  In 
 *  both Netbeans and Eclipse you can have packages in the same project.  If so, 
 *  the IDE will create a classpath that includes the two packages.
 *  If you have the Java files in different projects, then you need to tell the IDE 
 *  that one project is included in the other.  In Netbeans you do this in the Project
 *   Properties (see attached image).  In Eclipse there is a similar capacity in the
 *    Build Path of the project.*/
